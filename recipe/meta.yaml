  summary: A Python Progressbar library to provide visual (yet text based) progress to long running operations.
  description: |
    A text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a long
    running operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.

    The ProgressBar class manages the current progress, and the format of the line
    is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display
    differently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are many types
    of widgets:

     - `Timer`
     - `ETA`
     - `AdaptiveETA`
     - `FileTransferSpeed`
     - `AdaptiveTransferSpeed`
     - `AnimatedMarker`
     - `Counter`
     - `Percentage`
     - `FormatLabel`
     - `SimpleProgress`
     - `Bar`
     - `ReverseBar`
     - `BouncingBar`
     - `RotatingMarker`
     - `DynamicMessage`

    The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will also
    automatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.

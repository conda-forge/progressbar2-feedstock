  summary: A Python Progressbar library to provide visual (yet text based) progress to long running operations.
  description: |
        A text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a long
        running operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.

        The ProgressBar class manages the current progress, and the format of the line
        is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display
        differently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are many types
        of widgets:

         - `Timer`
         - `ETA`
         - `AdaptiveETA`
         - `FileTransferSpeed`
         - `AdaptiveTransferSpeed`
         - `AnimatedMarker`
         - `Counter`
         - `Percentage`
         - `FormatLabel`
         - `SimpleProgress`
         - `Bar`
         - `ReverseBar`
         - `BouncingBar`
         - `RotatingMarker`
         - `DynamicMessage`

        The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will also
        automatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.
